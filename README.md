# Valproic acid-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of valproic acid including non-linear binding with albumin in adults, children and children with hypoalbuminemia.
This repository contains:
- a PK-Sim snapshot (*.json ) file of the current PBPK model
- static content (*.md files) as inputs for an evaluation plan
- an evaluation plan (evaluation-plan.json) to create an evaluation report using the snapshot and static text blocks to display the performance of the model 
This PBPK model is intended to be used as a basis for the implementation of non-linear protein binding using PBPK/Mobi.  The PBPK model helped assess the nonlinear dose-exposure relationship of VPA and the impact of albumin concentrations on the achievement of target exposure.
This whole-body PBPK model of valproic acid has been developed using in published information and the parameters were optimized based on pharmacokinetic clinical data. 

The model has then been evaluated simulating a large number of clinical studies and comparing with respective observed data, obtained from published clinical pharmacokinetic studies. 

This model has been published[<sup>1</sup>](#references).
